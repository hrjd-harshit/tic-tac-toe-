How to Play the Game :

Both the players choose either X or O to mark their cells.
There will be a 3Ã—3 grid with numbers assigned to each of the 9 cells.
The player who chose X begins to play first.
He enters the cell number where he wishes to place X.
Now, both O and X play alternatively until any one of the two wins.
Winning criteria: Whenever any of the two players has fully filled one row/ column/ diagonal with his symbol (X/ O), he wins and the game ends.
If neither of the two players wins, the game is said to have ended in a draw.
